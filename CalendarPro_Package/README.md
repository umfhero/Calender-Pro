# Calendar Pro

A anti-modern desktop calendar application with a self imagined approach to month layouts and notes management. Found that most calander layouts on websites and apps we're unintuative to use. Built with Python and CustomTkinter, Calendar Pro prioritises intuitive month navigation over traditional calendar grids/layouts.

> I might just be slow for calendar apps, but this app works like a charm for me
